<h1>My Soul Animal</h1>
<p><i>My soul animal</i> is a <b>tiger</b>. Because I feel that tigers are brave and powerful in the animal kingdom.<br> So I would like to choose my soul animal as tiger . It gives a strength when I am scared . Tigers are usually strong enough to fight with their enemies and I feel that I am also strong enough to face any situation .Tiger is said to be willpower, courage, and personal strength.Tigers are fascinating for me . They live in a forest in which we find many beatiful creatures . Tigers travel all the time . They like travelling and I too like  travelling . I like seeing tigers . I saw tigers many tigers and I find them intersting all the times .</p>
